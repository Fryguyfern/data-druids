### Project Information:
[Digital Bullet Journal Application - Project Inception (WIP)](project-documents/project-inception-journal.md)

    A web app that serves as a digital bullet journal for users, allowing them to log daily entries on thoughts, moods, habits, and tasks.  The aim is a journal that facilitates personal growth and makes thoughtful reflection an easier part of a user's daily life.

    AI integration is leveraged to enhance journal entries with personalized insights and interactions based on user entries. Users can customize their personal experience to receive thoughtful prompts on mindfulness exercises or areas of reflection, or just feedback on how well they've been keeping up with habits or tasks recently. Users will also be able to personally or automatically tag entries to seamlessly link them to related entries, or overarching topics or goals. 

    Existing applications like GoodNotes, Notion, and Day One  are all appealing options as digital journals (with various costs), and some can even be leveraged to track tasks and habits or organize notes as well. Some focus purely on the essence of being a digital journal, and for others a significant amount of research or setup can be involved to suitably customize the functionality. This application aims to take features that are often separated in disparate applications, and consolidate them into one seamless experience that is effortless to begin.

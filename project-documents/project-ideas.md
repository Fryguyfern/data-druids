## Spotify Playlists & Visualizer:
A personalized playlist and music visualization tool that enhances listening experiences by intelligently managing track randomization, especially for genres like classical music. It allows users to create playlists where songs are grouped (e.g., entire classical works or specific artists) and randomized within or between those groups, avoiding awkward transitions like random classical movements. The app could also generate custom playlists based on a user’s mood, preferences, and favorite genres or artists, creating a more tailored, seamless listening experience. Visualizations would be something like https://musicscapes.herokuapp.com or https://receiptify.herokuapp.com; a personalized visual based on recent tracks and listening trends.

## What’s for lunch?
A web app designed for busy individuals who struggle with the daily decision of where to get lunch. The app generates personalized restaurant suggestions based on the user's preferences, such as cuisine, dietary restrictions, or favorite spots, along with factors like user reviews and proximity to their office. It also takes into account how much time they have, providing options within a set distance or estimated travel time. We were also considering delivery information, and information on restaurants supporting delivery is available, but estimates seem difficult without public APIs.
